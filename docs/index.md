# Welcome to the GARP documentation
## What is GARP?

GARP is a game resolution protocol for Ethereum based cryptocurrencies.
It will allow games to offer a waged gameplay in any of the supported crypto currencies.
It builds a bridge between game and game developers to crypto communities.

This bridge is realized via the GARP API and is documented here. 

## How does it work?
Games close typically with a result or score. That score is registered and then at a selected point
the game resolution is done and the waged coins are paid back according to a certain key.

The game resolution and the redistribution of the wage currencies is done per currency and after
a game developer defined key and consists of 3 components:

- Game developer reward
- Gamer reward (the five highest ranked players are rewarded)
- A network fee (0%-2.5%)

The first two elements are determined by the developer at game configuration on the portal.

An example:
Player 1 plays 5 games with Atheios (ATH), a player 2 plays 5 games with ETHO. The first
ranked scores will be then rewarded. Let assume player 1 is on the first 5 places.
The following will happen:- The developer will get for the game periode 1 ATH and 1 ETHO, the 
remaining 4 ATH and 4 ETHO will go to the player 1 (here we assume a network fee of 0% and that 20% go to the developer)

## What currencies are supported?
Currently we have support for the following currencies:

* Atheios
* Ether 1
* GARPX (coming in 2021)

Here is a list of languages or frameworks supporting GARP
